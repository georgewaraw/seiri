is a browser-based 3D horror FPS with PSone-esque visuals inspired by titles such as Twisted Metal. It should run on just about anything with a modern web browser and supports both mouse and keyboard as well as touch input, with some rudimentary PWA support for iOS (and likely Android too).

In it, you navigate a barren urban ladnscape, scoring points by disposing of an endless wave of monsters. Your only equipment is a flashlight (to see them at a distance) and a pistol. Each monster is worth a single point and takes three hits to kill. Your score is displayed upon death, which happens after coming into contact with a monster for too long. The movement speed is not that high, so being aware of your surroundings is key.

### controls

When using mouse and keyboard, press the WASD or the arrow keys to start moving in a given direction. Press the same key again to stop. Press Q or E to switch between a flashlight and a gun. Use the mouse to look around and left mouse button to shoot.

When using touch input, swipe up, down, left, or right to start moving in that direction. Swipe that way again to stop. Move your finger on the screen to look around. Tap the screen to shoot. Tap with more than one finger to switch between a flashlight and a gun.
